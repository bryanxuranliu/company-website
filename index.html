<div id="Frequently Asked Questions" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Have questions? Here are some answers!</h3>
  <p> <I> Q: Are tutoring prices negotiable? </I> <br /> A: alas, not with the rarest of exceptions. Tutoring is our main source of income as recent college-graduates. We need to keep tutoring prices at a higher level to keep up with the increasing cost of, well, life. <br /> <br /> <I> Q: so how does tutoring work if it's online? </I> <br /> A: tutoring is done through Zoom. Our team has iPads that we use to write on while sharing screen, so in essence it looks as if we are writing on a whiteboard in front of you. Having online lectures on Zoom also gives you the advantage to record the lecture if you wish. <br /> <br /> <I> Q: what if I do not like my tutor? </I> <br /> A: no problem! We can swap you out with another one of our tutors, as long as they can teach the same subject. <br /> <br /> <I> Q: how do I send the payment? </I> <br /> A: Venmo/Zelle is fine! <br /> <br /> <I> Q: what if my session is under an hour? Do I still get charged the hour-long fee? </I> <br /> A: I will adjust the price accordingly!</p>
