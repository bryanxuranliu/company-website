  <h3>Bryan Liu (Founder and CEO)</h3>

  <p>I received my bachelorâ€™s in mathematics in Spring of 2022 at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, California. For over half a decade I coached students, mostly at the high school level, on math and science. In my free time I enjoy playing the violin/piano, lifting weights, eating Korean barbeque with friends, writing fiction books, taking photos with my camera, and driving around at 1:00 AM enjoying the view of the city lights. </p>

<div id="Frequently Asked Questions" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Have questions? Here are some answers!</h3>
  <p> <I> Q: Are tutoring prices negotiable? </I> <br /> A: alas, not with the rarest of exceptions. Tutoring is our main source of income as recent college-graduates. We need to keep tutoring prices at a higher level to keep up with the increasing cost of, well, life. <br /> <br /> <I> Q: so how does tutoring work if it's online? </I> <br /> A: tutoring is done through Zoom. Our team has iPads that we use to write on while sharing screen, so in essence it looks as if we are writing on a whiteboard in front of you. Having online lectures on Zoom also gives you the advantage to record the lecture if you wish. <br /> <br /> <I> Q: what if I do not like my tutor? </I> <br /> A: no problem! We can swap you out with another one of our tutors, as long as they can teach the same subject. <br /> <br /> <I> Q: how do I send the payment? </I> <br /> A: Venmo/Zelle is fine!</p>
